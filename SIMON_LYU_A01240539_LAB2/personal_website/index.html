<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Simon. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in English and Commerce. 
    I come from a technical writing background and I like learning about how things work 
    and how they are made. I get asked a lot about what technical writing entails. 
    Does it involve more technical things than writing? The answer to that question is: 
    about “half and half”. In spite of what others say, good writing <em>does</em> matters 
    in technical writing. But having a well-rounded understanding of information technology 
    is equally if not <strong>more</strong> important for writing in technical fields.

<p>I’m currently taking full-time studies in IT. Here are
